The website aims to analyse a graph structure, represented by nodes and edges in the CSV
files, and perform a depth-first search to find the most critical path based on combined vulnerability
and severity scores. It provides insights into the risk associated with different paths in the
graph and information about hosts, vulnerabilities, and criticality levels.
